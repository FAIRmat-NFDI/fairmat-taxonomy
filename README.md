# FAIRmat Taxonomy for Materials Properties

Welcome to the FAIRmat Taxonomy repository! This is a work in progress, aiming to create a comprehensive taxonomy for materials properties to help power the data model of our software [NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/)

## Background and Related Projects

The initial materials properties and their classification are based on the original schema published by our colleagues from KRISS in the Korean Journal, "Jaeryo Madang" in 2022. For more details, please refer to our publication:

**S. Kim et al., "Structure of Materials R&D Data and Standard Vocabulary Dictionary," Jaeryo Madang, 35 (1), 67 (2022).**

Please note that currently, this paper is available only in Korean but the schema is hosted in this repo: [MatResData Standard Committee GitHub site](https://github.com/krlee227/MatResData-Standard-Committee).
